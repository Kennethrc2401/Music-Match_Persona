    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p>Emily is an accomplished vocalist. She has a busy performing schedule, and that leaves her with about 15 hours per week to teach and manage her teaching studio. In the past, she has managed her own studio, but she didnt like the amount of time that she ended up spending on finding new students and manually managing her teaching schedule. </p>
    <br>
    <p>She charges $70 per hour for her vocal coaching. She wants to be matched with advanced students who are ready to put in at least 10 hours of practice per week. The commissions charged by the site have to be relatively small and the benefits of scheduling through the site must be considerable, otherwise she will just tell her students to pay her directly.</p>
